Subject: ILAL - Reduce OUSG/USDY Trading Costs by 99.4%

Hi Nathan,

Thanks for connecting! I'm building ILAL - a zero-knowledge 
compliance layer that could enable OUSG/USDY on Uniswap v4.

Problem: Current RWA protocols face $2,000+/user/month compliance 
costs due to 252k Gas per transaction.

Solution: ILAL reduces this to $0.37/month through Session Caching - 
verify once, trade unlimited for 24 hours.

Key Metrics:
• 96.8% Gas reduction (252k → 8k Gas)
• PLONK zero-knowledge proofs (privacy-preserving)
• Uniswap v4 Hook integration (native liquidity)
• 97.6% test pass rate (production-ready)

Would love to discuss how this could benefit OUSG/USDY. 
Available for a 15-minute call this week?

Attached: Technical brief and architecture overview
